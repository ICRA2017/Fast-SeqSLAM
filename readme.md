% Modified the original code of  Niko SÃ¼nderhauf which can be found https://openslam.org/openseqslam.html
% The functions doProcessing, doFindMatches (doFindMatchesModified), doDifferenceMatrix, DefaultParameters are mainly modified.
% Other than this files, some parameters of the other files are modified.
% I used Flann libray for the Approximate nearest neighbour calculation.
% didn't implement the matching computation in the doFindMatchesModifed parallely so it may take longer time than the original
% seqSlam implementation which has implemented matching computation parallely
